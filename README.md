# infrastructure-tooling

Common Build, Test, and Analysis Github Actions

This repository provides a comprehensive suite of reusable GitHub Actions and workflows for building, testing, and analyzing on-chain (smart contract) projects. It serves as a centralized tooling solution that can be shared across multiple blockchain development repositories.

## üöÄ Overview

The infrastructure-tooling repository contains standardized CI/CD components specifically designed for Ethereum/EVM-based smart contract development workflows. It includes actions for building contracts, running tests, security analysis, code coverage reporting, and quality assurance checks.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

### GitHub Actions (`.github/actions/`)

#### Build & Test Actions
- **`install-foundry/`** - Installs and configures the Foundry toolchain (default: v1.2.1)
- **`install-dependencies/`** - Handles dependency installation for Python and Soldeer packages
- **`onchain-build/`** - Compiles smart contracts using Forge with optimization
- **`onchain-test/`** - Runs comprehensive test suites with support for mainnet forking

#### Code Quality & Analysis Actions

- **`code-coverage/`** - Generates LCOV coverage reports and posts results to pull requests
- **`slither-analysis/`** - Performs static security analysis using Slither with SARIF output
- **`medusa-fuzz/`** - Executes property-based fuzzing tests using Medusa fuzzer
- **`contract-size/`** - Validates contract bytecode size against Ethereum's 24KB limit

#### Documentation & Validation Actions

- **`markdown-link-checker/`** - Validates links in markdown files (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)

### Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

#### `onchain-build-test-report.yaml`

A comprehensive callable workflow that orchestrates the complete build and test pipeline:

**Features:**

- Markdown link validation
- Foundry installation and dependency management
- Contract size validation
- Smart contract compilation with optimization
- Test execution with mainnet/polygon forking support
- Code coverage analysis with PR reporting
- Configurable test parameters (salt strings, fork testing, etc.)

**Inputs:**

- GitHub App authentication support
- Multi-repository project support
- Customizable markdown file paths
- Fork testing configuration
- Environment-specific test settings

#### `onchain-code-quality.yaml`

Focused workflow for code quality and security analysis:

**Features:**

- Static security analysis with Slither
- Conditional fuzzing with Medusa (when `medusa.json` exists)
- SARIF report generation for security findings
- Automated PR comments with analysis results

### Utility Scripts (`.github/scripts/`)

#### `check-links.sh`

Bash script for markdown link validation:

- Installs and runs `markdown-link-check`
- Supports custom configuration files
- Handles comma-separated file lists
- Excludes common directories (node_modules, lib)

#### `contract-size.sh`

Contract size validation script:

- Parses Forge build output for contract sizes
- Warns for contracts >21KB (approaching limit)
- Fails for contracts >24KB (exceeds Ethereum limit)
- Color-coded terminal output for easy identification

## üîß Usage

### As a Callable Workflow

Add to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory:

```yaml
name: Build and Test
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build-test:
    uses: Forte-Service-Company-Ltd/infrastructure-tooling/.github/workflows/onchain-build-test-report.yaml@main
    secrets:
      ALCHEMY_KEY: ${{ secrets.ALCHEMY_KEY }}
      POLYGON_ALCHEMY_KEY: ${{ secrets.POLYGON_ALCHEMY_KEY }}
    with:
      fork-test: true
      salt-string: "CUSTOM_SALT"
```

### As Individual Actions

Reference specific actions in your workflows:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: Forte-Service-Company-Ltd/infrastructure-tooling/.github/actions/install-foundry@main
  - uses: Forte-Service-Company-Ltd/infrastructure-tooling/.github/actions/onchain-build@main
```
